nojson
======

A flexible JSON library for Rust with no dependencies and no macros.

`nojson` provides `fmt` and `str` modules for generating and parsing JSON.
It is designed as an extension to the standard library, 
featuring components like `JsonStr` and `DisplayJson` 
which are variations of `str` and `Display` tailored for JSON,
facilitating seamless integration with standard traits and types.
